### What Worked
- Account & scaffolding stood up on 4/17; wrappers (alpaca.sh, notify.sh) verified live
- Pre-market research workflow produced a structured entry with real catalysts and sourced data
- Caught sector leadership early: Energy/Materials/Industrials tilt identified before re-deploy
- Recognized Saturday = no action; avoided fake activity

### What Didn't Work
- Capital massively under-deployed: only $299.63 risked (0.3%) vs 75–85% target → missed a +4.5% S&P week
- Opened 3 token fractional positions ($100 each) instead of proper 15–20% sizes; no thesis-sized bets
- No 10% trailing stop GTC orders placed on open positions — rule 4 violated
- Queued blanket market-sell on all 3 within <24h of entry — churn, not conviction
- Patience > activity rule inverted: activity without size or stops

### Key Lessons
- A week with S&P +4.5% and ~0% deployed is the single most expensive mistake possible. Cash is a position — a losing one in a ripping tape
- "Test fills" with $100 sizes are not trades; they consume PDT/weekly-trade budget without expressing any thesis
- Every open position MUST have its trailing-stop GTC order placed the same session — not "next session"
- Don't round-trip a position before the stop even exists

### Adjustments for Next Week
- Monday: let pending sells fill, then deploy meaningfully — target 3 full-size positions (15–20% each), 50–60% deployed by Tue, 75–85% by Fri
- Every new entry: bracket or follow-on GTC 10% trail in the SAME command sequence as the buy
- Keep the 3-new-trades/week cap — use them on conviction names (CIEN, SNDK re-entry candidate after 4/20 Nasdaq-100 inclusion, energy/industrials basket)
- No more fractional "toe-dip" entries. Either trade the idea at size or pass

### Overall Grade: D

Rationale: scaffold works and research is disciplined, but the first real trading window saw ~0% deployment into a +4.5% S&P week and stops-rule violated on all 3 opens. Saved from F only because the positions are tiny and losses immaterial.
