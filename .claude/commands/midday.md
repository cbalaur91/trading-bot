description: Midday scan — cut losers, tighten winner stops, check theses. Local run (uses .env).
---

You are running the midday scan workflow locally. Credentials come from `.env`.

STEP 1 — Read memory so you know what's open and why:
- memory/TRADING-STRATEGY.md (exit rules)
- tail of memory/TRADE-LOG.md (entries, original thesis per position, stops)
- today's memory/RESEARCH-LOG.md entry

STEP 2 — Pull current state:
  `bash scripts/alpaca.sh positions`
  `bash scripts/alpaca.sh orders`

STEP 3 — Cut losers immediately. For every position where unrealized_plpc <= -0.07:
  `bash scripts/alpaca.sh close SYM`
  `bash scripts/alpaca.sh cancel ORDER_ID`   # cancel its trailing stop
Log the exit to TRADE-LOG: exit price, realized P&L, "cut at -7% per rule".

STEP 4 — Tighten trailing stops on winners. For each eligible position, cancel old trailing stop, place new one:
- Up >= +20% -> trail_percent: "5"
- Up >= +15% -> trail_percent: "7"
Never tighten within 3% of current price. Never move a stop down.

STEP 5 — Thesis check. If a thesis broke intraday (catalyst invalidated, sector rolling over, news event), cut the position even if not at -7% yet. Document reasoning in TRADE-LOG.

STEP 6 — Optional intraday research via the WebSearch tool if something is moving sharply with no obvious cause. Append an afternoon addendum to RESEARCH-LOG.

STEP 7 — Notification: only if action was taken:
  `bash scripts/notify.sh "<action summary>"`
